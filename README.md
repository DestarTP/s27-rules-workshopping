    * Representing their team to the CRC
2. Co-Captains are responsible for assiting the captain and filling in for them when they are unavailable
3. Captains may change who their co-captain is at any time by notifying the CRC

### Section C - Captain Types

1. Direct Playing Captain (DPC): DPCs are playing members of their rosters. DPCs start on their own roster during the auction draft, and receive TagCoins relative to their perceived skill.
2. Non-Playing Captain (NPC): NPCs are not playing members of their rosters. Prior to the draft, NPCs will select another player from the draft board who agrees to be their preliminary pick. Preliminary picks start on their captain's roster during the auction draft, and the captain will receive TagCoins relative to the perceived skill of their preliminary pick.
3. Indirect Playing Captain (IPC): IPCs are captains that wish to be a DPC but are determined by the CRC to be too skilled to skip the draft of the league above their captaincy signup. If an IPC is drafted to a league above their captaincy signup they may elect to become a NPC or forfeit their captaincy role. If an IPC is not drafted to a league above their captaincy signup then they will be accepted as a DPC.
4. General Manager (GM): GMs are not playing members of their roster. GMs do not receive preliminary picks and each GM receives the same number of TagCoins for the draft.
